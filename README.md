# Project Overview

<div style="margin-left: 4%">

With the adjustment to the global pandemic and the modernisation of the world we know, average day <br/> activities, which some have been around for centuries, are needing to find their way onto the virtual world. <br/> Geocaching has started to go out of fashion and is needing a new modern twist on the classic treasure hunt game.

<br/>

There is a need to have GeoCodes as there is a problem of caches going missing from people stumbling upon <br/> the caches without the knowledge of what they are. With GeoCodes the likely hood of a cache going missing is <br/> a lot smaller as it will only be a QR code sticker which people are a lot less likely to remove. A QR code is also a lot <br/> easier to replace. The use of a GeoCode also resolves the issue of logbooks being full and people unable to log <br/> their finds in the books as this will go digital.

<br/>

With the use of GeoCodes as QR codes it also means if someone stumbles upon the QR code and scans it they <br/> will be taken to the GeoCode website where they will be introduced to the concept and have the opportunity to <br/> join the GeoCode community.

# GitHub Management

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 4%">

A monorepo with the Git Flow structure will be used in the COS301-SE-2021 organization for the GeoCode project.
<br/>

The following type of branches will be used in the repository:
<br/>
* **master:** The current stable release version of the product. There will only be one of these branches.
* **release/vN.N:** A copy of the master branch for version N.N of the system.
* **development:** A branch consisting of finished code that will be included in the next push to master.
* **dev/SubsystemName:** The main development branch of a single subsystem.
* **dev/SubsystemName-FeatureName:** Used to indicate a new feature being implemented and tested.

 <br/>
      For the management of the project at least two team members will work on a single feature. When a feature has been implemented and tested it will be merged into the develop branch, 
      to merge the feature branch into the development branch a Pull Request will be made where a team member who did not work on the branch being merged will need to be assigned on the 
      branch to review the code and accept the Pull Request or request changes. This is done to ensure the separate subsystems of the project are integrated correctly and help ensure the 
      development branch will contain code and features that work correctly.
<br/><br/>
      The file structure for each of the different subsystem identified in the subsystem will be as such:

    ExampleSubsystem

    |------ controller
               |------ ExampleSubsystemApi
               |------ ExampleSubsystemApiController
    |------ exception
    |------ model
    |------ repository
    |------ request
    |------ response
    |------ service
               |------ ExampleSubsystemService
               |------ ExampleSubsystemServiceImpl
</div>

<br/>

   <pre>

            Michael StrÃ¶h has learnt throughout his university career that perseverance leads to
            excellence. Through working as a Teaching Assistant for COS 212 (Data Structures)
            and a Student Lab Technician in the CBT labs at the University Of Pretoria he has
            learnt how to manage his time wisely and effectively communicate not only as a team
            but also as an individual. As an Artificial Intelligence project Michael StrÃ¶h 
            successfully completed a Sudoku solver using Generic Algorithms and a flower 
            specimens classifier using Machine Learning with back propagation to identify 
            the different species of the iris flower, namely, iris setosa, iris versicolour 
            and iris virginica.
