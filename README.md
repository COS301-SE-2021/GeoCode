# Project Overview 

<div style="margin-left: 4%">

With the adjustment to the global pandemic and the modernisation of the world we know, average day <br/> activities, which some have been around for centuries, are needing to find their way onto the virtual world. <br/> Geocaching has started to go out of fashion and is needing a new modern twist on the classic treasure hunt game.
    
<br/>

There is a need to have GeoCodes as there is a problem of caches going missing from people stumbling upon <br/> the caches without the knowledge of what they are. With GeoCodes the likely hood of a cache going missing is <br/> a lot smaller as it will only be a QR code sticker which people are a lot less likely to remove. A QR code is also a lot <br/> easier to replace. The use of a GeoCode also resolves the issue of logbooks being full and people unable to log <br/> their finds in the books as this will go digital. 

<br/>
   
With the use of GeoCodes as QR codes it also means if someone stumbles upon the QR code and scans it they <br/> will be taken to the GeoCode website where they will be introduced to the concept and have the opportunity to <br/> join the GeoCode community.
