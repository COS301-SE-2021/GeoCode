</div>

We recommend reading this security document fully before you report any vulnerabilities. 
This helps ensure that you understand everything stated, and act in compliance with it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered something you believe to be an in-scope security vulnerability, 
please email <a href='peakperformers@geocodeapp.tech'> peakperformers@geocodeapp.tech </a> with the subject SECURITY.

Your report should provide a benign proof of exploitation wherever possible. 
This helps to ensure that the report can be triaged quickly and accurately and reduces the
likelihood of duplicate reports, or malicious exploitation of some vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This disclosure policy applies only to vulnerabilities in GeoCode project under the following conditions:

* ‘in scope’ vulnerabilities must be original, previously unreported, and not already discovered.
* volumetric vulnerabilities are not in scope - meaning that simply overwhelming a service with a high volume 
  of requests is not in scope.
* reports of non-exploitable vulnerabilities, or reports indicating that our services do not fully align with 
  “best practice” are not in scope.
* TLS configuration weaknesses are not in scope, for example “weak” cipher suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support.

## Supported Versions

The following versions of the GeoCode project are still supported and vulnerability reports are still accepted.
Please is the table that corresponds to the different applications versions.

## Bug Bounty

Peak Performers doesn't offer a paid bug bounty programme for the GeoCode Project.
Peak Performers will try their best effort to show appreciation to people who take the time and effort to 
disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Guidance

Anyone who found a security vulnerability must not:

* disrupt the GeoCode project in any way or form.
* access unnecessary amounts of data, do not access more than needed to show a vulnerability.
* use high-intensity invasive or destructive technical security scanning tools to find vulnerabilities.
* violate the privacy of anyone involved with the GeoCode project.
* modify data in GeoCode systems or services which will affect another entity.
* disclose any vulnerabilities in GeoCode project to 3rd parties or the public.
* require monetary compensation to disclose any vulnerabilities.
* social engineer, ‘phish’ or physically attack Peak Performers or infrastructure.

## Legalities

This policy is designed to be compatible with common good practice among well-intentioned security researchers. 
It does not give you permission to act in any manner that is inconsistent with the law, or which might cause the 
GeoCode project to be in breach of any of its legal obligations, 
including but not limited to (as updated from time to time):

* The Computer Misuse Act (1990)
* The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018
* The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988)
* The Official Secrets Act (1989)

Peak Performers affirms that it will not seek prosecution of any security researcher who reports any security
vulnerability on an GeoCode service or system, where the researcher has acted in good faith and in accordance
with this disclosure policy.
