   <pre>

            Michael Ströh has learnt throughout his university career that perseverance leads to
            excellence. Through working as a Teaching Assistant for COS 212 (Data Structures)
            and a Student Lab Technician in the CBT labs at the University Of Pretoria he has
            learnt how to manage his time wisely and effectively communicate not only as a team
            but also as an individual. As an Artificial Intelligence project Michael Ströh 
            successfully completed a Sudoku solver using Generic Algorithms and a flower 
            specimens classifier using Machine Learning with back propagation to identify 
            the different species of the iris flower, namely, iris setosa, iris versicolour 
            and iris virginica.
